class Condition:
    """
    The Condition class is to help select which students
    in the database will be included in following calculations.
    This is done by comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=)
    on an existing field (database header). When using these operators,
    the operands MUST be in the order of [<field>, <threshold>].
    For example, c1 = Condition('>=', ['exam1', 80]) would be a condition
    that selects all student who scored higher or equal to 80 on exam1.

    This class also supports Boolean operations (and, or, not).
    The operands for these must be instances of the Condition class,
    and obviously "not" should have one operand, while "and" and "or" have two.

    TO DO: write the validate function used to check that a condition is valid.

    The Query class contains all the information about what question
    we're trying to ask the database.
    "condition" selects which students, and it should be an instance
    of the Condition class above.

    example: "Of those that pass both exams, who scored highest on assignment 1?"
    should give condition:
    c1 = Condition('>=', ['exam1', 50])
    c2 = Condition('>=', ['exam2', 50])

    [operation, 'for each' or 'for all', [fields]]
    "operation" (string) should be one of [max, min, average, weighted average, none]
    'for each' means the operation should be done for each student, while
    'for all' means the operation should be done for all students selected
    ["fields"] is a list of fields that we're asking about

    the same example above should have calculation:
    q.calculation = ['max', 'for all', ['assignment1']]

    "expectedResult" tells me 1. how many? and 2. what? should be returned
    it is a list of length two:
    [how many, [what]]
    "how many" can be 'scalar', 'vector' (or 'list'), or 'table'
    [what] is a list of all fields that is asked for

    the same example above should have expectedResult:
